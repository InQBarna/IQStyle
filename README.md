# IQStyle
IQStyle is a lightweight set of classes and categories that allow the developer:
* Move most of the customization code to the xib/storyboard files.
* Have a unique place where colors and fonts (style) used in the app are defined.
* Change the style at runtime and have the views react to this change.
